# File Upload Attacks
File upload vulnerabilities pose significant risks to web applications, arising from inadequate file validation and outdated libraries, enabling attackers to exploit this feature maliciously. Such attacks range from unauthenticated arbitrary file uploads, leading to remote command execution via web shells or reverse shells, to introducing vulnerabilities like XSS or XXE, causing Denial of Service (DoS), or overwriting critical files. Mitigating these risks involves implementing robust validation, secure filters, and avoiding outdated libraries, alongside adopting best practices to fortify applications against these threats.
